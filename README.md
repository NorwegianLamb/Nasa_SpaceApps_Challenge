## What is the NASA Space Apps Challenge
The **NASA International Space Apps Challenge** is the largest annual global hackathon. This two-day event creates innovation through international collaboration by providing an opportunity for participants to utilize NASA’s free and open data and its Space Agency Partners’ space-based data to address real-world problems on Earth and in space.

The 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge theme is **"The Sun Touches Everything"** in collaboration with **NASA Heliophysics**. This theme is in alignment with the Heliophysics Big Year, a global celebration of the Sun’s influence on Earth and the entire solar system, as declared by NASA.

## Challenge Chosen and Description
Our team chose the **Gender and Climate** challenge.

The **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals** are a series of targets designed to promote human development and protect the environment. Two of the goals concern **gender equality** and **climate action**. While most people might consider these two topics to be quite disparate, they are actually closely related. Your challenge is to **model the relationship** between climate change and gender inequality, and propose a solution that promotes equality and action to support sustainable development for all.

## High-Level Summary
**Climate change** and **gender inequality** are arguably two of the greatest **sustainable development challenges** of our time.

The **2017 Global Environment Facility** (GEP) Policy on Gender Equality states that men and women use natural resources **differently**, and have different roles and knowledge in the use and management of natural resources.

As a result, they are affected differently by environmental policies, programmes, projects and changes to these resources.

Gender inequality and social exclusion increase the negative effects of environmental degradation on women and girls as the impacts of climate change, including on access to productive and natural resources, amplify existing **gender inequalities**.

Women’s dependence on and unequal access to land, water, and other resources and productive assets - which are compounded by limited mobility and decision-making power in many contexts - mean that they are disproportionately affected by climate change. 

## Project Description
A devastating fact is that after a **natural disaster**, women are more likely to become **victim of domestic and sexual violence** and may avoid using shelter from fear.

A study examining intimate partner violence after Hurricane Katrina, which hit the USA in 2005, revealed that **psychological victimization** of women and men increased by **35%** and **17%** respectively six months after the cyclone, while **physical victimization** of women increased by **98%**.

Climate change has increased the **frequency of disasters** due to floods and other extreme events, affecting particularly populations that are economically and socially marginalized. 

Within these groups, **women and children**, particularly girls, are often the most marginalized, due to socially constructed roles, lack of access to basic knowledge, information, amenities, transportation means and rights.

Climate change is increasingly causing people to **migrate** from their communities to find better social and economic opportunities.

Because of existing social norms that dictate the roles and responsibilities suitable for women and men, they tend to react to climate change pressures differently.

This project was meant to find the **relationship between violence towards women before and after natural disasters**, enabling international framework to **plan** gender-responsive actions to help as many victims as possible and **predicting** which countries will require more help after disasters.
