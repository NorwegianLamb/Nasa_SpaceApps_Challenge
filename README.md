## What is the NASA Space Apps Challenge
The **NASA International Space Apps Challenge** is the largest annual global hackathon. This two-day event creates innovation through international collaboration by providing an opportunity for participants to utilize NASA’s free and open data and its Space Agency Partners’ space-based data to address real-world problems on Earth and in space.

The 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge theme is **"The Sun Touches Everything"** in collaboration with **NASA Heliophysics**. This theme is in alignment with the Heliophysics Big Year, a global celebration of the Sun’s influence on Earth and the entire solar system, as declared by NASA.

## Challenge Chosen and Description
Our team chose the **Gender and Climate** challenge.

The **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals** are a series of targets designed to promote human development and protect the environment. Two of the goals concern **gender equality** and **climate action**. While most people might consider these two topics to be quite disparate, they are actually closely related. Your challenge is to **model the relationship** between climate change and gender inequality, and propose a solution that promotes equality and action to support sustainable development for all.
